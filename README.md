### Introduction:

-	Flappy Bird is a mobile game developed by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen, under his game development company .Gears. The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them.

### About:

-	The following represents a recreated version of the famous fluffy bird Game from google store implemented using **Python and PyGame**. The project file contains **Image Files** , **sound files** and **python files** .
-	The original code was just the game, it had been refactored and modified with the AI code using NEAT.
-	In addition, it has another python file that saves the neural network when it's done training and loads the nn and keep training from a saved point.
